### How to play the game
- Objective of the game is to get all the gems on the field and achieve the highest score possible
- Player spawns with 200 points! To incentivize you to get the gems faster, you lose points randomly every second until the game ends
- Running into enemy bugs or falling into the stormy waters of the first row will reduce your point score and spawn you back to your starting safe zone
- Grabbing gems will raise your score
- Once the game is over, either by you losing all your points or by getting all the gems, you can restart the game by pressing enter
- Enjoy!
